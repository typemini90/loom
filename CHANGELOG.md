# Changelog

All notable public release changes are tracked here. Loom also publishes release
archives, checksums, and provenance details on GitHub Releases.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `loom skill diagnose <skill>` for read-only skill health reports covering
  source files, Git drift, bindings, targets, projections, pending queue state,
  and related registry operations.
- Panel Diagnose tab on skill detail pages, including loading/error handling and
  refresh after lifecycle mutations.

### Fixed

- Diagnose reports now surface pending queue read problems and Git/source drift
  read failures instead of silently treating them as healthy.
- Projection-only/orphaned skills now report missing targets when no rule covers
  the projection target.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Skill trash, history timeline, realtime save watch mode, and registry backup
  export/restore workflows.
- Panel support for pending review follow-ups and the split handler module
  layout used by the V1 read/write surface.
- Launch readiness metadata: changelog, repository topics, issue templates, PR
  template, and README release-note links.

### Changed

- Refreshed Rust and Panel dependencies, including `uuid`, `serde_json`,
  TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, jsdom, and coverage tooling.
- Kept release archives aligned with the bundled Panel build and current
  dependency lockfiles.

### Fixed

- Addressed post-review follow-ups across the skill lifecycle, registry
  operations, and Panel routes merged after `v0.1.1`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Rollback preview and impact analysis for safer registry recovery planning.
- `loom skill verify` with documentation for the skill source threat model.
- Agent preflight dry-run planning for high-risk automation flows.
- Panel pages and APIs for projections, doctor checks, orphan cleanup, lifecycle
  actions, activity, and operations history.
- V1 registry contracts for health envelopes, command audit, snapshot audit, and
  union skill read models.

### Changed

- Panel release builds now bundle the frontend into the Rust binary.
- Release trust guidance now covers archive checksums and GitHub attestation
  verification.
- CI now uses cargo-nextest for the Rust test suite.
- Dependency refreshes for Rust, GitHub Actions, and the Panel toolchain.

### Fixed

- Hardened audit-critical registry flows, rollback failure reporting, command
  audit recording, target path canonicalization, and secret redaction in command
  events.
- Improved CLI agent ergonomics, `--version` wiring, Panel failure visibility,
  and skill lifecycle documentation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Initial public release archives for Loom.
